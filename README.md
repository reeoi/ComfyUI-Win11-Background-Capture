# ComfyUI Win11 Background Capture (Occluded) 👻

A ComfyUI custom node that allows capturing specific application windows on Windows 11, **even if they are covered by other windows (occluded)** or running in the background.

## Features ✨

*   **Background Capture**: Uses Windows `PrintWindow` API to capture windows hidden behind others.
*   **Region Selection (ROI)**: Interactively select a specific area of the target window to capture.
*   **Occlusion Support**: No need to keep the window on top. Perfect for workflow automation.
